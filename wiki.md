## Week 2
* The entire group installed unity and forked the coupled sim repository.
### Idea - What will we research on?
The group brainstormed on a few research topics. One of which was pedestrian-vehicle interaction. In this experiment, we are intersted to know what the pedestrian looks at when looking at a AV. Is it 
* the 'supposed' driver sitting on the driver seat, 
* the passenger next to him or
* a screen mounted in the front of AV that has eyes.

## Week 3
The main focus of this week was to learn the basics of unity. 
### Things that we learnt about unity
* We got to understand a basic overview of hierarchy of unity ( i.e. scene is parent, then game object, then components etc.). 
* Additionally, we learnt how to navigate around the map, view objects and its properties and were able to drive a car in the given environment. 
* We also were able to conduct sessions where one of our group member was the host and other two were clients. This was done on 3 separate systems. Along with that, we were able to assign roles for different clients (One was driver, other was pedestrian). The demo example provided in the coupled-sim repository was used to conduct these sessions. 

### Things yet to be learned
* We still need to understand how to add custom objects in a scene. 
* We also need to learn how scripts in unity work so that we can program a car to behave autonomous. 

Apart from that, the group will explore on more scenarios to apply the course learnings apart from the idea discussed in week 2.
