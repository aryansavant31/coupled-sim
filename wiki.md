## Week 2
* The entire group installed unity and forked the coupled sim repository.
### Idea - What will we research on?
The group brainstormed on a few research topics. One of which was pedestrian-vehicle interaction. In this experiment, we are intersted to know what the pedestrian looks at when looking at a AV. Is it 
* the 'supposed' driver sitting on the driver seat, 
* the passenger next to him or
* a screen mounted in the front of AV that has eyes.
